            <p>CDK LLC (“CDKeys.com”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to respecting privacy and data protection
                compliance.</p>

            <p>This privacy policy together with Appendix A (“Privacy Policy”) sets out how and why we collect, store,
                use, transfer and disclose your personal data (also referred to as personal information in this Privacy
                Policy) and how you may access your personal information and correct it. This Privacy Policy also
                explains the use of cookies on our Site.</p>

            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, “personal data” or “personal information” means information that specifically
                identifies an individual (such as a name, address, photo, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail
                address, birthday, office location, professional and personal interests, company name, title department,
                and spoken languages) or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally
                identifiable information.</p>

            <p>“Site” means https://www.cdkeys.com/ and all subpages and subdomains related to https://www.cdkeys.com/
                and any additional website domains as determined by CDKeys.com from time to time. ”User”, “you” and
                “your” collectively mean the person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Site. A
                user may be a visitor of CDKeys.com or an Account holder. “Account” means the account that users may
                create through the Site.</p>

            <p>For the purposes of the data processing and control, the relevant legal entity is CDKeys.com. Our contact
                email address for any communications regarding your personal data is <a
                    href="mailto:data@cdk.ae">data@cdk.ae</a> (please include “personal data” in the email subject).</p>

            <h2>GDPR</h2>

            <p>If you are a resident of the European Union, you are protected by, and enjoy additional, rights under the
                European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, also known as GDPR.</p>

            <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p>We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and at our sole discretion. Although we will use our
                best endeavours to notify you of any amendment to this Privacy Policy, we will not be required to
                provide you with prior notification of such amendments or changes to this Privacy Policy. We encourage
                you to frequently check our Site for any changes to our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>Your continued use of our Site, services, requesting our assistance or the provision of further personal
                information to us (directly or via an authorised person) after any change in this Privacy Policy will
                constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

            <h2>What data do we collect?</h2>

            <p>Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
                site, and the date and time of each visitor request.</p>

            <p>We collect non-personally identifying information to better understand how our visitors use our Site. The
                information collected will also help us troubleshoot problems, analyze our resources and improve our
                services and/or products. There is nothing in that kind of information that could enable anyone to
                identify who you are.</p>

            <p>We also collect potentially personal information including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>your name</li>
                <li>your contact information including your email address</li>

                <li>cookies. For the complete list of cookies we collect see the List of cookies we collect section.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How do we collect personal data?</h2>

            <p>We collect personal information in a number of ways, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>when you or a third-party contact us independently of our Site, such as by email, phone or in
                    person
                </li>
                <li>when you visit and interact with our Site and related software (including any mobile applications)

                    programme
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>when you contact us via our Site or sign up for our newsletter/mailing list</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In each case, we collect such personal information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill
                the purpose of your interaction with us. We do not disclose personal information other than as described
                below in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>You may refuse to supply personal information; however, this may prevent you from engaging in certain
                Site-related activities, and we may not be able to provide our services and/or products or assistance to
                you or on your behalf.</p>

            <p>You must not provide us with the personal information about another person unless you have first obtained
                that person's prior consent to do so and you have told them their personal information will be handled
                in accordance with this Privacy Policy (including where to find it). By providing us with information
                about any third party individual, you hereby warrant and represent that you have all necessary consents
                and permissions to do so, and that you can provide proof of the same to us.</p>

            <p>We will not sell, distribute or lend access to your personal information to third parties unless we have
                your permission or are required by law to do so. We may use your personal information to send you
                promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you have given us
                permission for this to happen.</p>

            <p>If you have previously given us permission to use your personal information for direct marketing
                purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to us at <a
                    href="mailto:info@cdk.ae">info@cdk.ae</a>.</p>

                particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application
                can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information
                about your preferences.</p>

            <p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web

                statistical analysis purposes, after which the data is removed from the system.</p>

            <p>Cookies help us provide you with a better website by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful

                cookies if you prefer. You should note that this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site

                    improve the way our Site works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are
                    looking for easily.

            <h4>1. More detailed background on data collection</h4>

            <p><strong>Information we collect, and how we do it</strong></p>
            <p>We collect information, both general and personal, in a number of ways, as detailed in this Privacy
                Policy. In the case of personal or personally-identifiable information, we collect information only
                insofar as it is, and remains, necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us. We collect
                and store information using a number of technologies such as cookies, caches, databases, and logs. We do
                not use or disclose personal information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>You may refuse to provide us with personal information, and you may object to our collection of
                information; however, this may impact your ability to use or benefit from our Site, platforms, apps,
                products, and/or services, and our ability to provide you with support or assistance.</p>

            <p><strong>Information you provide, content you create, and files you upload</strong></p>
            <p>When you create an Account on our Site and other affiliated platforms, including any mobile applications,
                you provide us with personal information that includes your name, email address, phone number, and a
                password.</p>
            <p>Even if you do not create an Account, you may opt to provide us with personal information for specific
                purposes. For instance, you may provide us with an email address to receive marketing material or
                updates about our services or a phone number so that we may call you back about a customer inquiry.</p>
            <p>We also collect content that you create, upload, or receive from others when using our Site and other
                platforms. This includes comments as well as orders, invoices, sites and documents you generate.</p>

            <p><strong>Information we collect about your browser and devices</strong></p>
            <p>While you use our Site and other platforms, we collect general information of the sort that web browsers,
                servers and network operators typically make available, such as unique identifiers (e.g. persistent
                cookies, MAC addresses, device IDs, IMEI numbers), browser type and settings, location data, device type
                and settings, operating system, IP address, mobile network information including operator name and phone
                number and application version number, language preferences, crash reports, system activity, and the
                date, time and referral URL of each visitor request. This information helps us to troubleshoot problems,
                understand how visitors use our Site, allocate and balance resources, and improve our products and
                services.</p>
            <p>Some of this information could be personal data, i.e. data that is personally-identifiable (that is they
                could be used to directly or indirectly identify you as an individual and natural person)—information
                like IP addresses, phone numbers, and unique identifiers. We treat such information in the same way that
                we treat all other personal information (such as your name), and will only use and disclose such
                personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p><strong>Information we collect about how you use our Site and services</strong></p>

                you use our services, such as the links that you click, content that you view, terms, products, and
                services that you search for, products that you buy, people you communicate, or share information, with,
                and how you interact with advertisements.</p>
            <p>We collect information about your activity to understand how you use and interact with our Site, other
                platforms, our products and services. This helps us understand customer preferences, optimize our Site
                and other platforms, allocate and balance resources, and improve our products and services.</p>
