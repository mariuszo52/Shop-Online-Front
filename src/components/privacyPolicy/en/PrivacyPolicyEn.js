            <p>20. Hardware problems preventing the use of the game and errors within the game are not grounds for complaint and return.

            <p>24. Based on Article 38 points 9 and 13 of the Act of May 30, 2014, on consumer rights (Journal of Laws of 2014, item 827), the right to withdraw from a distance contract does not apply to the consumer in relation to contracts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a. where the subject of the service is a sound or visual recording or computer program delivered in a sealed package, if the package has been opened after delivery;</li>
                <li>b. providing digital content that is not stored on a tangible medium, if the performance of the service began with the explicit consent of the consumer before the deadline for withdrawal from the contract and after informing him by the entrepreneur about the loss of the right to withdraw from the contract.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Therefore, withdrawal from the contract is not possible, among other things, after the User has downloaded the activation code.
